## <p align="center">FAQ for Beta 9 of The Retro Arena RG Arc Linux Firmware</p>




### 1. Scraper tells me to "Refresh update games lists to apply changes" but there is no option to.

*Press the Start Button in the Main Menu, go to Quit at the bottom and select to Restart Emulation Station to update your Game Lists.*

### 2. How do I connect to WiFi?

*Go to the Retroarch folder in the Main Menu and open Retroarch. Go to Settings -> Wi-Fi -> Connect to Network.*

### 3. My Networks are missing in the Retroarch Wi-Fi -> Connect to Network Menu. How do I make them show up?

*If Retroarch Scans for Networks and does not find your Network you will need to back out with the B button twice and Quit Retroarch. In the Main Menu go to Options -> Advanced -> WIFION(Options -> WIFION if you have folders hidden) and your system will reboot. Once you go back to Connect to Network in Retroarch your Networks should now appear.*

### 4. How do I update the software?

*Once you are connected to Wifi you can go into Options -> Arcupdate to open the OTA Update Software. By default it will have Updating to the latest Version highlighted and you will only need to press the A button to confirm. Once the update has completed and you are back at the Main Menu go to Options -> Fix Permissions. After the Fix Permissions script sends you back to the Main Menu press the Start Button and go down the menu to Quit -> Restart.*

### 5. How do I change my Theme?

*Go to Options -> Misc -> Thememaster(Options -> Thememaster if you have folders hidden) to download new Themes(Warning: a few themes are not compatible and will be partially broken or will be completely missing text - will note at a later time).*

### 6. How do I open the menu while playing a game?

*By default this is set to L2 + R2 for Retroarch based emulators. For Yaba Sanshiro Standalone(Sega Saturn) you can use the Select Button.*

### 7. How do I exit a game?

*By default this is set to F(Function Key on the top of the device) twice.*
