## <p align="center">FAQ for Beta 9 of The Retro Arena RG Arc Linux Firmware</p>




### 1. Scraper tells me to "Refresh update games lists to apply changes" but there is no option to.

*It updates the game list upon restart of Emulation Station. Press the Start Button in the Main Menu, go to Quit and select to Restart Emulation Station.*

### 2. How do I connect WiFi?

Go to the Retroarch folder in the Main Menu and open Retroarch. Go to Settings -> Wi-Fi -> Connect to Network. 

### 3. My Networks are missing in the Retroarch Wi-Fi -> Connect to Network menu. How do I make them show up?

If it Scans for Networks and does not find your Network you will need to back out with the B button twice and Quit Retroarch. In the Main Menu go to Options -> Advanced -> WIFION and your system will reboot. Once you go back to the Retroarch Connect to Network menu  your Networks should now appear.

### 4. How do I update the software?

Once you are connected to Wifi in Retroarch go into Options -> Arcupdate. Once the update has completed go to Options -> Fix Permissions. Press the Start Button and go down the menu to Quit -> Restart

### 5. How do I change my Theme?

Go to Options -> Misc -> Thememaster to download new Themes(Warning: Some themes are not compatible and will not look correct).

### 6. How do I open the menu while playing a game?

By default this is set to L2 + R2 for Retroarch based emulators. For Yaba Sanshiro Standalone(Saturn) you can use the Select Button.

### 7. How do I exit a game?

By default this is set to F(Function Key on top) twice.
