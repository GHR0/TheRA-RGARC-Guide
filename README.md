1. Scraper tells me to "Refresh update games lists to apply changes" but there is no option to. 

It updates the game list upon restart of Emulation Station. Hit start, go to quit and restart Emulation Station.

2. How do I connect WiFi?

Go to the Retroarch folder and open Retroarch. Go to Settings -> Wi-Fi -> Connect to Network. 

3. My Networks are missing in the Retroarch Wi-Fi -> Connect to Network menu. How do I make them show up?

If it scans and does not find your networks you will need to back out with the B button twice and Quit Retroarch. Go to Options -> Advanced -> HDMI-ON. Your system will reboot then you can go back into Retroarch and your Networks should now appear when using Connect to Network.

3. How do I update the software?

Once you are connected to Wifi in Retroarch go into Options -> Arcupdate. Once the update has completed go to Options -> Fix Permissions. Press the Start Button and go down the menu to Quit -> Restart

4. How do I change my Theme?

Go to Options -> Misc -> Thememaster to download new Themes(Warning: Some themes are not compatible and will not look correct).

5. How do I open the menu while playing a game?

By default this is set to L2 + R2 for Retroarch based emulators. For Yaba Sanshiro Standalone(Saturn) you can use the Select Button.

6. How do I exit a game?

By default this is set to F(Function Key on top) twice.
